# klipper control python
This Python project is written by Euris Montanez.
This is the first project in which my aim is to incorporate all that I learned in the Python package requests.

TODO Learning:
1. Learn how to comment correctly.
2. Learn requests functions, like json(), get(), and post().
3. Learn how to interact with arrays and dictionaries.
4. Learn the Moonraker API, which is connected to my raspberry pi running fluiddpi. (https://moonraker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/web_api/)
5. Find the best way to make a GUI on Python, that can show a live web camera feed. (Maybe Tkinter? I hate this package ;-;)
6. Maybe try to code my own AI that checks to see if the print has failed.

TODO Moonraker API:
1. The documentation for this API is properly written.
2. Can control the printer via requests fairly easily.
3. Might be able to stream webcam footage through the API.


TODO HTML?:
1. Planning on making a nice GUI since, this is an application I most likely would use.
2. Touch up on my html skills.
    TODO Websockets??:
    1. Apparently, WebSockets allow the program to send real-time information back and forth.
    2. This could be what I need for getting my webcam to work, and a GUI that automatically updates the information sent to temperatures.

TODO Webcamera:
1. Use Moonraker API to stream live footage straight into the app.
TODO Numpy and Panda:
1. I eventually want to somehow include ai in this maybe like a "pasta" detective or something :)...
2. I need to learn ai.
